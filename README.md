# HAX for builds
This repo contains prebuilt versions of HAX based on running build routines against source. This can make it easier to integrate HAX into platforms by referencing a build (either CDN or adding this version to your platform) and not need to build HAX from source (via bower / npm) in order to utilize it.

HAX + Polymer + Common element set found in the haxtheweb.org demo. The index file located in this same directory will provide a simple "app" integration.
